To use this lib do the import
import gl

To call the functions you do

C.glSomeFunctionName()

The naming convention for functions is

first gl and the the name of the function (CamelCase) and not (snake_case)

for constants and enums its just (snake_case)

good luck and watch out for the glShaderSource function!
